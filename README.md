Effective Field Theory for the induced dipole interaction.

Short-range (or pionless) EFT ignores long-range interactions. With vdW systems,
we learned that there is some benefit to including the known "long-range"
behavior at leading order. Here, we will study how well that works for the
induced-dipole interaction between a charged particle and the neutral hydrogen
atom. This interaction goes like an attractive $1/r^4$.

We use the Mott-Massey potential as a reference. At LO, we tune the scattering
length to the MM scattering length. And at NLO, we match the sixth excited
state, $B_6$.
